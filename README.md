In this project I use the data to answer some questions with the intention of guiding landlords of shared housing charging stations to better help them understand their tenants needs regarding adequate supply of charging stations via answering these three questions :
1) I found the number of individuals that use each charging station
2) I identified bottleneck times at the charging stations
3) I idientified how many users needed ten or more hours per charging session
